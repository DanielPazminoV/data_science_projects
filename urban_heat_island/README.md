## Introduction

The urban heat island (UHI) effect refers to the phenomenon where urban areas experience higher temperatures compared to their surrounding rural areas due to the built environment, human activities, and lack of vegetation. The intensity of the UHI effect can vary depending on a range of factors, such as local climate, urban density, building materials, and green spaces. While there are cities around the world that are known to experience significant UHI effects, determining the city with the "highest" UHI effect can be complex and may vary depending on the criteria and methodology used for measurement and comparison.

It's important to note that the intensity of the UHI effect can vary within a city depending on local factors such as land use patterns, building density, and the presence of green spaces. Additionally, UHI effects can change over time due to urban planning, mitigation efforts, and climate change impacts. Accurate and comprehensive measurement of UHI effects requires sophisticated monitoring and analysis techniques, including satellite imagery, ground-based measurements, and modeling.
