# Paute River Basin: Water Balance and Drought Analysis 🌊🌦️

This project focuses on analyzing the water balance and drought conditions within the Paute River Basin using Python-based tools and datasets. It is divided into several parts, each addressing specific aspects of the analysis.

## Project Structure 📂

The project is organized into the following Jupyter Notebook files:

1. **Parts 1 to 3** (`Paute_water_balance_and_drought_analysis_parts_1_to_3.ipynb`):
   - Initial exploration and preprocessing of hydrological data. 🗂️
   - Calculation of water balance components. 📊
   - Overview of historical trends in precipitation and evapotranspiration. 🌧️☀️

2. **Part 4** (`Paute_water_balance_and_drought_analysis_part_4.ipynb`):
   - Advanced hydrological modeling. 📈
   - Assessment of seasonal variability. 🍂🌷
   - Visualization of spatial and temporal patterns. 🗺️

3. **Part 5** (`Paute_water_balance_and_drought_analysis_part_5.ipynb`):
   - Drought indices calculation and analysis. 🌵
   - Case studies of drought events within the basin. 📖
   - Final summary and recommendations. ✅

## Requirements 🛠️

- Python 3.8 or higher 🐍
- Jupyter Notebook 📓
- Key libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scipy`, `xarray` 📦

Install the dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data Sources 📊

The analysis relies on hydrological and meteorological datasets, including:
- Historical precipitation and temperature records. 🌡️
- Basin-specific data on soil and land use. 🌍
- Remote sensing products (where applicable). 🛰️

## Usage 🚀

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd paute-water-balance
   ```

2. Open the notebooks in Jupyter:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. Execute the notebooks sequentially to reproduce the analysis. 🔄

## Key Outputs 📈

- Time series plots of water balance components. 🕒
- Maps illustrating spatial variability in drought conditions. 🗺️
- Statistical summaries of hydrological trends. 📊
