# Paute River Basin: Water Balance and Drought Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing the water balance and drought conditions within the Paute River Basin using Python-based tools and datasets. It is divided into several parts, each addressing specific aspects of the analysis.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following Jupyter Notebook files:

1. **Parts 1 to 3** (`Paute_water_balance_and_drought_analysis_parts_1_to_3.ipynb`):
   - Initial exploration and preprocessing of hydrological data.
   - Calculation of water balance components.
   - Overview of historical trends in precipitation and evapotranspiration.

2. **Part 4** (`Paute_water_balance_and_drought_analysis_part_4.ipynb`):
   - Advanced hydrological modeling.
   - Assessment of seasonal variability.
   - Visualization of spatial and temporal patterns.

3. **Part 5** (`Paute_water_balance_and_drought_analysis_part_5.ipynb`):
   - Drought indices calculation and analysis.
   - Case studies of drought events within the basin.
   - Final summary and recommendations.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- Key libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scipy`, `xarray`

Install the dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data Sources

The analysis relies on hydrological and meteorological datasets, including:
- Historical precipitation and temperature records.
- Basin-specific data on soil and land use.
- Remote sensing products (where applicable).

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd paute-water-balance
   ```

2. Open the notebooks in Jupyter:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. Execute the notebooks sequentially to reproduce the analysis.

## Key Outputs

- Time series plots of water balance components.
- Maps illustrating spatial variability in drought conditions.
- Statistical summaries of hydrological trends.
